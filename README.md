School Performance Analysis

Overview

This project uses Python to analyze school performance data by school type and size, focusing on metrics like average scores and passing rates. The code is organized in a series of steps for data manipulation and analysis.

Steps for the Code

1-Import Libraries
Load the required libraries, primarily pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib (if visualizations are included).

2-Load Data
Import the school data into a DataFrame. Make sure the data file path is correct.

3-School Size Categorization
-Define bins for categorizing school size (Small, Medium, Large) based on the number of students.
-Use pd.cut() to label each school by size.

4-Calculate Performance Metrics by School Size
Group the data by school size and calculate:
-Average Math Score
-Average Reading Score
-Percentage Passing Math
-Percentage Passing Reading
-Overall Passing Percentage
These calculations help understand if size affects performance.

5-Calculate Performance Metrics by School Type
Group the data by school type (Charter or District) and calculate the same metrics as above to compare how the type of school impacts student outcomes.

6-Create Summary Tables
Organize the calculated metrics into summary tables by school size and school type. These tables give a clear view of performance differences.

7-Display Results
Print the summary tables for analysis and interpretation. Optionally, use visualizations to present findings more effectively.


Requirements

Python 3.x
Pandas for data handling
Matplotlib (optional for graphs)
Usage

To run this analysis, open and run the HW4g.ipynb notebook in Jupyter. Each cell is organized to perform one part of the analysis, making it easy to follow and modify.

Interpretation

After running the analysis, review the summary tables to see how school size and type influence performance. The tables highlight key trends that can guide further insights or decision-making.
